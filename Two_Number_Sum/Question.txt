Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers
 and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the 
 input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return  
  them in an array, in order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, 
  the function should return an empty array. N

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different 
integers in the array, You can't add a single integer to itself 
in order to obtain the target sum. You can assume that there will 
be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target some.

Example:
array = [1, 5, -4, 8, 11, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10

Solution:
[-1, 11]

Optimal space and time complexity:
O(n) time and O9n) space, when n is the length of the input aray
