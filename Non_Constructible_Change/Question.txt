Non-constructible Change

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins 
in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount 
of change (the minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. 
The given coins can have any positive integer value and are not 
necessarily unique (ex: you can have multiple coins of the same value).

For example, if you are given coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount 
of change that you cannot create is 4. If you are given no coins the 
minimum amount of change that you cannot create is 1.

Example:
coins = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]

Solution:
--> 20

Optima space and time complexity:
O(nlongn) time and O(1) space, where n is the number of coins
