Sorted Square Array

Right a function that takes in an non-empty array of integers that
 are sorted in ascending order and return a new array of the same 
 length with the with the square of the original integer also 
 sorted in ascending order.

 Example:
array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]

 Solution:
[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]

 Optimal space and time co mplexity:
 O(n) time and O(n) space, when n is the lenght of the imput array
