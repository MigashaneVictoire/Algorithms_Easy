Class photos

It's photo day at the local school, and you were the photographer 
assigned to take class photos. The class that you will be 
photographing has an even number of students, and all these students 
are wearing red or blue shirts. In fact exactly half of the class is 
wearing red shirts, and the other half is wearing blue shirts. You 
are responsible for arranging the students in two rows before taking 
the photo. Each row should contain the same number of students and 
should adhere to the following guidelines:

    1. All students wearing red shirts must be in the same row.
    2. All students wearing blue shirts must be in the same row.
    3. Each student in the back row must be strictly taller than the student directly in front of them in the front row.

You are given two input arrays: one containing the heights of all 
the students with red shirts and another one containing the height 
of all the students with blue shirts. The array will always have the 
same length, and each height will be a positive integer. Write a 
function that returns whether or not a class photograph that follows 
the stated guidelines can be taken.

Note: You can assume that each class has at least two students.

Example:

Solution:

Optimal space and time complexity:
O(nlogn) time and O(1) space, where n is the number of students.
